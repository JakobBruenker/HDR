  In this exercise, we were instructed to use the algorithm proposed by
  \cite{rbs99} to take a set of images of the same scene with different
  exposure times and use them to recover an high dynamic range image of the
  scene, as well as the response curve of the used camera. As well as doing
  this, I have implemented a way to write the recovered image to a File in the
  OpenEXR format, and to display a tonemapped version of the recovered image,
  using the algorithm from \cite{dmac03}.
