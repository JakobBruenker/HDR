\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

For this exercise, I first implemented the algorithm proposed in \cite{rbs99},
which can be used to take a set of spatially aligned input images of a scene,
with different exposure times, and, simultaneously, iteratively recover the
response curve of the camera and the luminance of the original scene. This will
be discussed in section \ref{hdr}.

Additionally, I implemented a way for the recovered image to be saved in
OpenEXR format. This will be discussed in section \ref{exr}.

I also implemented the tonemapping algorithm found in section \cite{dmac03},
which makes it possible to see the entire dynamic range of a scene mapped to a
regular screen. This is discussed in section \ref{toma}.

Finally, in section \ref{doc}, I will explain how to compile, run and use the
program.
